Welcome to my little space. I'm **Henning** and I will be your guide here.

I am a photographer located in southern germany. I have a on and off relationship with photography for twelve years now. I like to be in the nature for running and biking and ... like everything is better in nature. Therefor many motives of my photographs are in nature as well. Especially night photography and long exposures are my passion.

For the future I want to dive more into fine art portraits to tell stories of people with one image. If you landed here and you are interested in colab for something, let me know.

Please have a look over my images below or on the other pages :) .
