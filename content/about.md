My name is **Henning** and two hearts are beating in my heart. One for beeing outside and making sports in nature and the other for photography. On and off I am into photography for now twelve years but in the last month the hobby got more prioritized therefor you will see more new stuff on this site in the future. For now I will upload the IMHO best photos here for you to enjoy (?) them.

As you will see I do a lot of nature, night and some travel photography. But I want to dive more into portraiture or to be more specific into *fine art* portratiture. I never did a lot of people stuff but I think this is a thing I wanted to change.

Another thing I want to focus more on is color correction and color grading. Sometimes the result is an image with a ... special color composition but be patient with me. We will get there :D 

For now enjoy my work and get in touch for anything you want to know or tell. And I am always happy to work together with other passionate people and learn together or from each other.
